My base settings for when I start in a new environment.

## Requirements

Set zsh as your default shell:

```bash
sudo chsh -s $(which zsh)
```

## Setting up your Mac

- Update macOS to the latest version with the App Store;
- Install Xcode from the App Store, open it and accept the license agreement;

## Install

```bash
git clone git://github.com/exy/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
```

## fzf

To enable the FZF in command line you need to follow [this guide](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf#installation).

## Generate the SSH Keys

It's required to generate in every machine you start.

- Go to your $HOME with `cd ~`;
- Generate the new key `ssh-keygen`;

## Troubleshoot

### Homebrew

If you get any permissions problems when trying to run `brew` scripts, try to give the following permissions to your current user:
```bash
$ sudo chown -R $(whoami):admin /usr/local && sudo chmod -R g+rwx /usr/local
```
